# WiFi Jammer / Deauth Monitor Configuration
# Copy this file to config.yaml and customize for your environment

# Database configuration
database:
  path: data/monitoring.db  # SQLite path (relative to project root)

# Role: "relay" (central server with dashboard and optional local WiFi collection)
#       or "node" (client that collects WiFi and pushes to relay)
role: relay

# Relay settings (used when role: node, or when relay serves config to nodes)
relay:
  url: null       # e.g. http://192.168.1.100:8050
  api_key: null   # Shared team API key for nodes to authenticate to relay

# Node identity (used when role: node; name and location appear on relay map)
node:
  name: null      # Display name for this node
  location:
    latitude: null   # For map display
    longitude: null

# Local Wi-Fi monitor (deauth frames and RF jamming inference)
# Continuous monitoring: capture cycles run back-to-back. Requires interface in monitor mode and root or CAP_NET_RAW. Install tshark or scapy.
devices:
  local_wifi:
    enabled: false
    interface: wlan0
    ssid: null      # SSID to monitor (interface set to that channel). Preferred over channel.
    channel: null   # Fallback channel (1-14 for 2.4 GHz, 36+ for 5 GHz)
    monitor_capture_seconds: 30   # Duration of each capture; cycles run back-to-back
    deauth_threshold: 5
    jamming_noise_threshold_dbm: -70
    jamming_snr_threshold_db: 10

# Dashboard (relay binds here; nodes do not need to run dashboard)
dashboard:
  host: 127.0.0.1  # 127.0.0.1 = localhost only, 0.0.0.0 = all interfaces
  port: 8050
  debug: false

# Event detection (jamming-related only)
event_detection:
  thresholds:
    deauth_count_threshold: 5  # Deauth frames per capture above which deauth_burst is raised
